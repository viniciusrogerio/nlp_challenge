# Introduction

The field of NLP - Natural Language Processing is a part of AI dedicated to understanding text data and deriving patterns and useful information from it. One of the tasks associated with NLP is the classification of documents (texts), where algorithms are trained to automatically identify the category of the texts according to their content. This can be done both using supervised learning techniques (such as in this challenge), where there is labeled data available, or unsupervised learning, where labels do not exist in the first place.

In this challenge, a dataset containing information about scientific articles in the field of Astrophysics is given. The first goal is to predict which subjects are related to each article, and as we can see further, this is a multilabel problem, since each article can be associated to multiple subjects.

Finally, the ultimate goal is to predict the number of articles for each subject in each month of the test set.
